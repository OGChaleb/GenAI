Dear Mr. Amali,

Thank you for your inquiry.

**Requirements for the presentation**

1. A draft version of the presentation must be submitted before the due time so that the course instructor can provide comments and suggestions.  
2. The final presentation must be submitted **two weeks prior to the class presentation**.  
3. Feedback received on the draft should be incorporated into the final version (and, if applicable, into the term paper).  
4. The presentation should reflect the co‑creation approach outlined in the course, elaborating both individual and group interventions.

**Content to be covered**

I do not have information on the specific topics that should be included in the presentation.

If you would like to discuss this further or need clarification, you may book an appointment through the following link: https://calendly.com/manuelfritz/meeting

Best regards,

Prof. Dr. Manuel Fritz  
Business School Pforzheim
