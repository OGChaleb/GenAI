Dear Karim,

Thank you for your question about the upcoming presentation in the Generative AI course.

**What you need to do**

1. **Presentation content** – During the lecture you will present selected aspects of Generative AI. The syllabus does not prescribe a specific format, but you should prepare a concise presentation (e.g., slides) that covers the key topics discussed in class.

2. **Draft submission** – A draft version of your presentation must be submitted before the scheduled lecture so that I can provide feedback. The final version should be submitted at least two weeks before the presentation date.

3. **Evaluation** – Assessment and evaluation criteria will be posted on the university’s e‑learning platform (https://elearning.hs-pforzheim.de). Please review them carefully to ensure your presentation meets the expectations.

4. **Office hours** – I encourage you to use my office hours (colloquium) to discuss your outline, receive advice, and synchronize regularly with me. If you would like to schedule a meeting, you can book an appointment here: https://calendly.com/manuelfritz/meeting

If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Prof. Dr. Manuel Fritz  
Business School Pforzheim
